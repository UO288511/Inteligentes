    "As you already know, problems that require **machine learning** to be solved are those where we do not know the *formula* that allows us to transform the input into the output. These problems are mainly divided into two types: **supervised** and **unsupervised**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will focus on supervised learning problems, where we aim to predict either one or more classes (**classification**) or one or more numerical values (**regression**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in order to solve supervised learning problems, we always need **labeled data**, meaning data where we already know the expected output or correct label for a given input. These labeled examples will be used by the model to try to learn that *unknown formula* during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by exploring **classification problems**, their characteristics, evaluation metrics, techniques, and how they are used to make predictions.\n",

    "### **Objective**\n",
